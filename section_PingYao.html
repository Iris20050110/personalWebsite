        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Pingyao, an ancient city for more than 2700 years, was located on the Loess Plateau
        in northwestern China. The city was originally founded during c.700 BCE and was expanded
        and repaired in 1370 AD during the Ming dynasty. In 1997, the Ancient City of Pingyao
        became one of the World Heritage sites. Today Pingyao was one of the few
         ancient cities in China that still has its permanent residents. The purpose of preserving
         this city was to develop local economy by tourism while the historical heritage
         was protected at the same time. The city retains not only the tangible heritage like the
         city wall and the imperial court for more than 400 years but also the intangible
         cultural heritage like paper-cut, lacquerware, and pottery roof tiles.<br>
         <br>&nbsp &nbsp In the summer of 2020, I decided to go to Pingyao to investigate the past and the
         present of the city and to help restore the cultural heritage in the city. During the week of
         volunteering, I learned to make a piece of push-light lacquerware. I helped record the roof
         tiles' patterns by imprinting the patterns into papers. I visited the paper-cut senior's home
         and learned this art. When I rambled through the bustling commercial street in this ancient city,
          I decided to research on how well the city combined the cultural heritage with the modern
          business elements. I also found that the residents in the city was actually facing many
          employment issues and transportation issues.</p>

         <h3>Make Push-Light Lacquerware</h3>
            <h4>Day1 & Day6</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>Making push-light laquerware is a complicated process. The first step
            is to gather the raw lacquer. The workers would collect liquid resin from
            lacquer trees. I smelled the liquid resin in the lacquerware factory, but
            the pungent smell not only makes people dizzy but also could cause cancer.
            This same method of making lacquerware, however, had been used for thousands
            of years.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The next step of scraping dust is to coat the lacquerware. The dust is
            made of the raw laquer and other pigments. The dust is generally divided into
            coarse dust, medium dust, and fine dust. Following the steps, workers apply the
            coarse dust first, then the medium dust and fine dust. In the factory, I saw a
            female worker was scraping dust on a piece of lacquer furniture. She usually had
            to work for more than 12 hours each day, five days a week. Through the picture,
            we could see that her hands had covered with a thick layer of dust.</li>

            <br>

            <li>After air-drying for 2-3 weeks, the workers had to brush the lacquer with
            layers of camphor oil. The lacquerwares required several to a dozen layers of
            camphor oil, depended on the material of the lacquerwares. In the factory, I saw
            another worker was brushing the camphor oil.</li>

            <br>

            <li>The nest step was my turn. In a separate roon in the lacquerware factory,
            I observed an artisan paiting an old man on a piece of lacquer furniture. I
            decided to write a calligraphy on my lacquerware. I first outlined of edges of
            the characters, then painted with the black and red pigmants with a little brush.
            It was more difficult to paint with the brush than I though because it was easy
            to paint out of the edge. The auspicious calligraphy meaned "to be the top rank."</li>

            <br>

            <li>After drying for 6 days, I came back to the lacquerware factory again. This
            time, my task was to polish the lacquerware which I had worked on. The process
            of polish required repeatedly rubbing lime and oil on the lacquerware by hands.
            The process was tedious and long, but tens of thousands of workers still had to
            repeat this work day by day for years. This step allowed the lacquerware to keep
            its bright colors for decades.</li>

        <h3>Protection of the Pottery Roof Tiles, Wadang</h3>
        <h4>Day2</h4>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp The roof tiles in Pingyao often simbolized either auspicious meanings or
        mythologies. Yet, as the roof tiles experienced the corrosion from the winds
        and the sun for hundreds of years, how could we protect the cultural meanings
        in the Wadang tiles? The answer was rubbings.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>After fixing the paper on the top of the tile, I sprinkled water on the papar
            because it would make the paper and the tile fit better.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Then, I used the larger and smaller sandbags to dip in the ink and repeatedly tap
            on the paper. Due to the uneven surface of the tiles, the larger sandbags could quickly
            outline the shape of the tiles. The smaller sandbags were used to supplement details. I
             had to be careful not to break the paper during the process of tapping.</li>

            <br>

            <li>After repeating this process for about 20 minutes, I separated the paper and the tile.
            The shape of the tile impressed on the paper. The artisan here told me that the Wadang tile
            I just used was from the Qing dynasty, which was more than 200 years ago. Therefore,
            although the tile itself might corrodes or be damaged, its beautiful pattern was copied
            down permanently.</li>

        <h4>Day3</h4>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp In the third day, I visited the senior artist of paper cut in Pingyao. The old lady was
        the last successor of the traditional Pingyao paper cut. She began to learn paper cutting
        in high school, and it had been more than half a century since then. In the not spacious yard,
        I saw various paper cuttings hanging on all the walls. There, I accompanied with her and
        completed a paper cut.</p>

        <h3>Research: How Can We Protect Our Cultural Heritage?</h3>
        <h4>Day4</h4>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Walking on the commercial street in Pingyao, my friend and I found that
        most of stores were still based on the old buildings for more than a hundred years. Yet,
        did the residents today still know the history and heritage behind these old buildings?
        How well did they do in protecting these cultural buildings? With our questions, my
        friend and I decided to research on the designs and history of these buildings.<br>
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp In order to collect data, our invastigation methods was to interview
        the store owners on the commercial street and to observe the patterns on the old buildings.<br>
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp After a morning survey, we collected 30 sample data in total. In these samples,
        over half of the old buildings retained the patterns of bats, lotus flowers, and clouds on
        the eaves and facades of these buildings. All these patterns represented auspiciousness. On
        about 1/3 old buildings, we also observed the patterns like fruits, deer, and fable stories.
        These symbols often had the meanings of health and longevity.<br>
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp Most of our data, however, was obtained through observation. When we interviewed
        the shop owners, except those who were not willig to answer the questions, most of them were
        business men from other provinces and did not know much about the history of the buildings.
        These buildings were usually subletted two to three times, thus it was very likely that the
        tenants did not know the real owners of these buildngs at all.<br>
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp Based on the research, although the buildings in Pingyao retained their ancient
        appearance, they all had varying degrees of tear and wear. Since most of the original owners had left
        this ancient city, the buildings were either leased to the merchants or abandoned. The shopkeepers'
        awareness of cultural protection was still waiting to be strengthened.</p>

         <h3>Research: The Life of the Peoples in Pingyao Nowadays</h3>
        <h4>Day5</h4>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Today despite of the single prosperous commercial street and the large
        number of tourists each year, many small alleys in Pingyao were facing serious
        dilapidation. According to one of the Pingyao resident we interviewed, there was not
        a single primary school in the city. Thus, the parents had to send their children to
        school in the more "modern" cities nearby. Nonetheless, the ten-meters-high city walls
        still seriousely hindered the travel and transportation of the residents until today.
        Only two monthes after I left Pingyao, the ancient city wall collapsed due to a rainstorm
        in October 2021.<br>
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp Consequently, the meaning of this voluntary trip to Pingyao was to not only protect
        the historical heritage but also improve today the people's life. I will certainly go back
        to Pingyao a few years later. By then, I hope that I could see not only the cultural
        protection but also a more convenient life for people. The historical heritage was never
        the destination, the beautifu life today is.</p>
