           <h3>Coronavirus Second Wave in Europe</h3>
           <h4>Date: October, 2020</h4>
            <h4>By Iris Li</h4>
            <p><br>&nbsp &nbsp Recently, as the nothern hemisphere ushered in fall,
            and the weather is turning cooler, many countries in Europe
            are experiencing a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases. On October 17,
            local time, the German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier was
            quarantining after one of his bodyguards tested positive for
            the coronavirus, according to the spokeswoman for the president’s office.
            However, not only in Germany, but the number of daily new cases
            in other European countries has increased rapidly.
            Many experts worry about whether the European countries can
            survive during this second wave of coronavirus. In response to
            the rebound of the pandemic, different European countries
            also adopted different actions.
            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp On October 17, the German president Steinmeier was
            due to appear at the Frankfurt Book Fair to attend an
            award ceremony, but those plans have now been canceled due
            to the quarenrine. Though Steinmeier's first test came back
            was negative, according to a spokesperson for the president’s
            office, he remains in quarantine because the bodyguard is
            considered as a first-degree contact person of the president.
            Further tests for Steinmeier are planned in the coming days.
            So far, three German officials have tested positive including
            Thomas Haldenwang, the president of the Federal Office for the
            Protection of the Constitution (BfV), and two vice presidents.
            Germany recorded 7,830 coronavirus infections in the 24-hour
            period on October 17, which is the highest daily figure since
            the pandemic began, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp On the same day, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, urged
             residents to stay at home amid a dramatic increase in the number
            of coronavirus infections in Germany. "I ask you to refrain from
            any trip that is not really necessary, any celebration that is not
            really necessary. Please stay at home —  wherever you are,
             whenever possible," she said.
            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp In the other European countries, new restrictions went into
            effect in an effort to slow down the second wave of COVID-19.
            For instance, in Paris and other eight French cities, restaurants,
            bars, cinemas, and other establishments were forced to close after
            9 pm. Russian army have also set two mobile hospitals in Moscow,
            as the number of new infections kept increasing.

         <h3>2020 in Review: Moments That Made Us Smile during Pandemic</h3>
            <h4>Date: January, 2021</h4>
            <h4>By Iris Li</h4>
            <p><br>&nbsp &nbsp Looking back on 2020, some people joke that “living” has
            become an achievement. In January, COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan;
            In July, Olympics in Tokyo was canceled due to pandemic; In December,
            a new variant swept through England… In this special time period,
            every second has been recorded in history while we peeked a
            corner of the sky from the window during the quarantine. Yet,
            some warm moments are still worth remembering in this colder winter than ever.<br><br>

            <br>March 22: Cheer for Frontline Workers in New York<br>
           <br>The coronavirus swept through the whole world last spring.
           But in a corner of the world, at 7 pm each evening, kids after school,
           mothers who were cooking, and fathers who just got off work all peeked
           their heads from the windows with the shouts of “WOOOO”. With the buzzing
           of drums, guitars, and horns, all neighbors cheered in salute to the
           hospital workers, who faced the plague in the frontline. In the rough
           spring wind in New York, this cacophony is not the cry of triumph,
           but of the burning flame in people’s hearts. No matter how dark the
           night is, this flame will never extinguish. This flame is known as hope.

            <p><br>July 6: The Best Artworks Created by Washington Post Readers<br>
            <br>In summer, Washington Post asked their readers to share their artworks
            during pandemic and quarantine. Soon, they received more than 650 submissions
            from teens to 90-year-olds. Among these, some artworks depicted life under
            pandemic using bright colors, and some portrayed doctors in the frontline
            with black, white, and grey. Nonetheless, all these arts sent a signal:
            the desire to return to normal life. All people are waiting and hoping for
            a day when doctors can take off their masks, when ICUs were no longer crowded,
            and when laughter reappears on the streets.

             <p><br>December 25: Love in Flowers<br>
            <br>At Beijing Foreign Studies University, flowers were always placed in
                every corner of the campus. According to the students in the university,
                the flowers are regularly changed and replaced by their classmates. Cards
                with blessings to strangers are also placed beside these flowers:
                “Have a nice day!”; “If you found love, take a rose with you!”;
                “If you are depressed, take a rose for yourself!”… Every flower carried
                a piece of kindness from strangers. But if we put all these pieces together,
                they became the most splendid sea of flowers in life.

         <h3>Earth Month: Tips for going green in April</h3>
            <h4>Date: April, 2021</h4>
            <h4>By Iris Li</h4>
            <p><br>Each year, Earth Day on April 22 leads to Earth Month.
            April 22, 2021 marks up the 51st Earth Day. Starting from 1970,
            Earth Day advocated people around the world to care more about
            our environment and climate. With the theme of “Restore our Earth”
            this year, let’s start to make a plan to celebrate it!</p>

                <li>Use less electricity. The easiest way to save electricity
            is to turn off the lights and the electrical appliances when unnecessary.
            For example, there is no need to turn on lights during a sunny morning.
            When you leave a room, also remember to turn off all the lights and electrical appliances.</li>
            <br>

               <li>Save water. Although 70% our planet is made up of water,
               only 2.5% freshwater we can use. We can save water in our daily life
               simply by turning off the faucets when we do not use it. Make sure that
               the faucets do not leak water.</li>
            <br>

               <li>Use less gas. Car exhaust largely pollutes the atmosphere above Earth,
               but we can hardly travel to different place without driving cars.
               Try to walk more or ride a bike if the distance is not far. You can
               also make a plan to take public transportations, such as bus and subway,
               in somedays of a week.</li>
